# Wavelet-Energy-Spectrum
Here I'm sharing the code of the wavelet energy spectrum. It has been used in my previous publications, such as:

<ul>
  <li>Shadlou, M, Contribution to the static and dynamic response of piles in liquefiable ground, 2016, PhD thesis, University of Bristol.</li>
  <li>Bhattacharya S., Tokimatsu K., Sarkar R., Shadlou M., Rouholamin M., 2014, ‘Collapse of Showa bridge during 1964 Niigata Earthquake: quantitative analysis based on current knowledge and eye witness’, Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Vol. 65, pp. 55-71.</li>
  <li>Emadi A., Shakib H., and Shadlou M., 2014, ‘Investigation of beneficial and detrimental effects of soil- foundationstructure interaction on the seismic response of shear buildings’, KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, Vol. 18, No.1, pp. 253-263</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dependencies:</h3><br>
 - MATLAB <br>
 - Wavelet Toolbox<br>
 
 Using the code is simple and straighforward.
